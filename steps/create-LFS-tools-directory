# $LFS/tools will contain a minimal Linux system that is just capable to
# build the final (Linux from scratch) system.
#
# This minimal Linux system is under $LFS/tools to keep it seperate from the «real»
# Linux built in chapter 6.
#
# There are two steps in building this minimal system:
#  1) build toolchain (assember, compiler....)
#  2) use toolchain to build other essential tools
