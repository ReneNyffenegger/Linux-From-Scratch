#  First, change the default location of the vimrc configuration file to /etc:
echo '#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE "/etc/vimrc"' >> src/feature.h

# Disable a test that fails:
sed -i '/call/{s/split/xsplit/;s/303/492/}' src/testdir/test_recover.vim

# Prepare Vim for compilation:
./configure --prefix=/usr

# Compile the package:
make

# To test the results, issue:

# TODO: temporarily untrapping errors
trap - ERR
make -j1 test &> /lfs/logs/vim.make-test
# However, this test suite outputs a lot of binary data to the screen, which can cause issues with the settings of the current terminal. This can be resolved by redirecting the output to a log file. A successful test will result in the words "ALL DONE" at completion.

# Install the package:
make install       &> /lfs/logs/vim.make-intall

# Many users are used to using vi instead of vim. To allow execution of vim when users habitually enter vi, create a symlink for both the binary and the man page in the provided languages:

#
#  TODO: Is this really necessary?
#
ln -sv vim /usr/bin/vi
for L in  /usr/share/man/{,*/}man1/vim.1; do
    ln -sv vim.1 $(dirname $L)/vi.1
done

# By default, Vim's documentation is installed in /usr/share/vim. The following symlink allows the documentation to be accessed via /usr/share/doc/vim-8.0.586, making it consistent with the location of documentation for other packages:

ln -sv ../vim/vim80/doc /usr/share/doc/vim-8.0.586

# If an X Window System is going to be installed on the LFS system, it may be necessary to recompile Vim after installing X. Vim comes with a GUI version of the editor that requires X and some additional libraries to be installed.
# For more information on this process, refer to the Vim documentation and the Vim installation page in the BLFS book at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/8.1/postlfs/vim.html.
